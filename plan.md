# PartFlow Project Development Plan (Agile Approach)

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines a phased, sprint-based approach to completing the PartFlow project. The goal is to deliver a high-quality, well-tested application by breaking down the work into manageable, one-week sprints.

**Methodology:** Agile (Scrum-like) with 1-week sprints.  
**Key Roles:**
*   **Product Owner:** David (Defines features, prioritizes backlog)
*   **Development Team:** Gemini (Implements features)

## 2. Detailed Project Plan (by Sprints)

### **Sprint 0: Foundation & Setup (1 week)**

*   **Goal:** Prepare the project for development.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Initialize Git repository and define a branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).
    *   Configure `pom.xml` with all necessary dependencies.
    *   Set up an issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues) with initial epics and user stories.
    *   Define and finalize the database schema.
    *   Create initial entity classes (`Part`, `Vendor`, `Sale`, `User`).
    *   Set up basic Spring Security configuration.

### **Sprint 1: Core Backend - Part & Vendor Management (1 week)**

*   **Goal:** Implement core functionality for managing parts and vendors.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Develop `PartRepository` and `VendorRepository` with Spring Data JPA.
    *   Implement `PartService` and `VendorService` with full CRUD operations.
    *   Write unit tests for services and repositories.
    *   Create initial data seeding for testing purposes.

### **Sprint 2: Core Backend - Sales & User Management (1 week)**

*   **Goal:** Implement core functionality for managing sales and users.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Develop `SaleRepository` and `UserRepository`.
    *   Implement `SaleService` and `UserService`.
    *   Implement logic for updating inventory when a sale is made.
    *   Write unit tests for the new services and repositories.

### **Sprint 3: UI - Main Structure & Dashboard (1 week)**

*   **Goal:** Build the main application window and the dashboard.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Create the main FXML layout with a sidebar for navigation.
    *   Implement the `MainController` to handle view switching.
    *   Design and implement the `Dashboard.fxml` view.
    *   Implement the `DashboardController` to display key metrics (e.g., total parts, low-stock items).
    *   Integrate the dashboard with the backend services.

### **Sprint 4: UI - Inventory & Vendor Management (1 week)**

*   **Goal:** Build the UI for managing parts and vendors.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Design and implement `Inventory.fxml` and `Vendors.fxml`.
    *   Implement `InventoryController` and `VendorsController` for full CRUD functionality.
    *   Integrate the views with `PartService` and `VendorService`.
    *   Implement search and filtering functionality.

### **Sprint 5: UI - Sales & Restocking (1 week)**

*   **Goal:** Build the UI for processing sales and managing restocking.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Design and implement `Sales.fxml` and `Restocking.fxml`.
    *   Implement `SalesController` and `RestockingController`.
    *   Integrate the views with the `SaleService` and `PartService`.

### **Sprint 6: Reporting & Finalization (1 week)**

*   **Goal:** Implement the reporting feature and prepare for release.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Design and implement `Reports.fxml`.
    *   Implement `ReportsController` to generate and display sales reports.
    *   Conduct full end-to-end testing of the application.
    *   Address any remaining bugs and perform final code cleanup.
    *   Write user and developer documentation.

### **Sprint 7: Deployment & Handoff (1 week)**

*   **Goal:** Deploy the application and hand it off.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Create a production-ready build (e.g., an executable JAR or a native installer).
    *   Finalize all project documentation.
    *   Perform a final User Acceptance Testing (UAT) session with the Product Owner.

## 3. Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Testing:** Use JUnit and Mockito to test individual components in isolation.
*   **Integration Testing:** Use Spring Boot's testing framework to test the interaction between different layers of the application.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Manually test the complete application flow to ensure all features work as expected.
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** The Product Owner will validate that the application meets all requirements at the end of each relevant sprint.

## 4. Definition of Done

A feature or task is considered "done" when:
*   The code is written and adheres to the project's coding standards.
*   All relevant unit and integration tests are written and are passing.
*   The feature has been successfully tested end-to-end.
*   The Product Owner has reviewed and approved the feature.
